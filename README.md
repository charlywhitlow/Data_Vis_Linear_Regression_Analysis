# Linear Regression Anaylsis with Python

This piece of work was part of a second year university module: Data Processing and Visualisation.

The coursework analyses a dataset of health indicators for the state of Florida (found in 2017Health.txt), and uses it to build a linear regression model to predict 'Years of Potential Life Lost'.

We then compare 2 possible models for the data, and analyse which model is better, and whether the difference is statistically significant.

The work is saved in a Jupyter notebook.

### Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model

The least squares approach fits a regression line by minimising the sum of the squared difference of each data point from the mean.

### Statistical Significance

Statistical significance describes the likelihood that a relationship between two or more variables is caused by something other than chance.

Tests for statistical significance return a p-value, and statistical significance is generally accepted at a p-value of less that 0.05.
