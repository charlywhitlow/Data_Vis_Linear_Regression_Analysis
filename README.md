# Regression Anaylsis with Python

This piece of work was part of a second year university module: Data Processing and Visualisation.

The coursework analyses a dataset of health indicators for the state of Florida (found in 2017Health.txt), and uses it to build a linear regression model to predict 'Years of Potential Life Lost'.

We then compare 2 possible models for the data, and analyse which model is better, and whether the difference is statistically significant.

The work is saved in a Jupyter notebook, which can be [previewed with nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/charlywhitlow/Data_Vis_Linear_Regression_Analysis/blob/master/DataVis_RegressionModels.ipynb).
